 Westside is cheap. Let's make it cheaper with these hidden 33% discount. Westside won't advertise this but I'll show you. Welcome to episode 2 of Girl Math where I share smart money tips for women that no one will ever tell you. So follow along. To get the Westside discounts, do this. Step 1. Don't pay normally with your cash or card. That's not smart. Instead, download the Tata New app. Step 2. Get the Tata New HDFC Infinity card and then simply buy Westside vouchers on the Tata New app and pay with it. On using the card on Tata brands, you anyway get 5% off. But because you're buying the voucher from the app, you get an additional 8% off. Your total discount? 13%. But we won't stop here. Step 3. In your birthday month, you get flat 20% off. But all you need is a phone number and the registered person's Sum ID. So you can use anyone's birthday month. Your mom, dadaji, sister, anyone. So plan for it and your total discount becomes 33% every time you shop. Well, that's the thing about us girls. We don't break rules. We just read them. Save it. Share it.
